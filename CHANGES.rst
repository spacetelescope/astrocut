Unreleased
----------


1.1.0 (2025-09-15)
------------------

- Bugfix for transposed GWCS bounding box for ASDF cutouts. [#160]
- Bugfix to correct ``array_shape`` and ``pixel_shape`` for GWCS objects. [#160]
- By default, ``ASDFCutout`` makes cutouts of all arrays in the input file (e.g., data, error, uncertainty, variance, etc.)
  where the last two dimensions match the shape of the science data array. [#158]
- By default, ASDF cutouts now preserve all metadata from the input file. [#158]
- Add ``lite`` parameter to ``ASDFCutout`` to create minimal cutouts with only the science data and updated world coordinate system. [#158]
- Add history entry to ASDF cutouts specifying the cutout shape and center coordinates. [#158]
- Remove TICA (TESS Image Calibration) as an option for the ``product`` parameter in ``TessFootprintCutout``. [#161]
- Deprecate the ``TicaCubeFactory`` class. [#161]
- Deprecate the ``product`` parameter in the ``TessCubeCutout`` class, the ``TessFootprintCutout`` class, the ``cube_cut`` function,
  the ``CutoutFactory.cube_cut`` function, and the ``cube_cutout_from_footprint`` function. [#161]


1.0.1 (2025-05-12)
-------------------

- Bugfix so ``ASDFCutout.get_center_pixel`` preserves the GWCS bounding box. [#154]
- Bugfix in ``ASDFCutout`` to use deep copies of data and GWCS to avoid links to original ASDF input.


1.0.0 (2025-04-28)
-------------------

- Introduce generalized cutout architecture with ``Cutout``, ``ImageCutout``, and ``FITSCutout`` classes. [#136]

- Add ``ASDFCutout`` class as a specialized cutout class for ASDF files. [#137]
- Allow ``ASDFCutout`` and ``asdf_cut`` to accept multiple input files. [#137]
- Deprecated ``output_file`` parameter in ``asdf_cut`` in favor of making outputs from a batch of input files.. [#137]
- Return ASDF cutouts in memory as ``astropy.nddata.Cutout2D`` objects, ``asdf.AsdfFile`` objects, or ``astropy.io.fits.HDUList`` objects. [#137]
- Enable output of ASDF cutouts in image formats. [#137]
- Refactor ``TicaCubeFactory`` to inherit from ``CubeFactory``. [#143]
- Optimize ``CubeFactory._update_info_table`` to open FITS files only once. [#143]
- Add ``TessCubeCutout`` class as a concrete implementation of abstract ``CubeCutout`` with TESS-specific logic. [#146]
- Introduce ``TessCubeCutout.CubeCutoutInstance`` inner class for per-cutout attributes. [#146]
- Enable in-memory output for ``TessCubeCutout`` instances. [#146]
- Add ``TessFootprintCutout`` class as a concrete implementation of abstract ``FootprintCutout`` with TESS-specific logic. [#149]
- Enable in-memory output for ``TessFootprintCutout`` instances. [#149]
- Bugfix so ASDF cutouts store a copy of the cutout data rather than a view into the original data. [#153]


0.12.0 (2025-01-21)
--------------------

- Implement and document ``cube_cut_from_footprint`` function to generate cutouts from TESS image cube files hosted on the S3 cloud. [#127]
- Bugfix to properly catch input TICA product files in ``CubeFactory``. [#129]
- Add a logging framework. [#131]
- Improve performance of FITS image cutouts by using the ``section`` attribute of ``ImageHDU`` objects to access data more efficiently. [#132]
- Bugfix when writing multiple output files to memory in ``fits_cut``. [#132]


0.11.1 (2024-07-31)
--------------------

- ``asdf_cut`` function now accepts `pathlib.Path` and `s3path.S3Path` objects as an input file. [#119]
